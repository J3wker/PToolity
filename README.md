**I DONT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT YOUR ACTIONS USING MY TOOLS - I CREATED THEM FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

**ARP Tools - the ARP_Poison V1**
the ARPv1 is the most basic ARP Poison program i created - the V2 on the other hand
isn't done it - but the goal is to create a program that tracks the user even if he changes his IP 
the V2 features a simpler method of getting the MAC address which gets the MAC Address only ONCE when starts running instead of getting it every time the loop runs

**DNS Spoofing** 

My thought about the DNS Spoofing was that i need 
to create a Program simple enough to perform a DNS Spoofing attack
but not be too complicated as create a whole DNS Server
so i created a system that targets only one website at a time
if you would like i will upgrade it to target more websites at the same time

**Code Injector**

The Code injector program can inject ANY code you want! 
all you need to do is enter the code you want to inject and run SSLSTRIP
*note: if you want i can implement SSLStrip inside the code injector

**Sniffer** 

Sniffer is simple - it has filters to get only the GOOD Shit - The important stuff
in the packets like passwords and such.
the Sniffer has the ability to choose from which interface to sniff
